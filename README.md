# YourJourneyScenarios
Scenarios for Your Journey game app

Scenarios need to be stored in your Documents/YourJourney folder (which should be created automatically the first time you run the game).

You can download a Standalone scenario by following these steps:
1. Use GitHub's file explorer (above) to find file you want to download.
2. Click it to view the contents within the GitHub UI.
3. In the top right, right click the Raw button.
4. Use your browser's Save As... functionality to save the filename ending with .jime in your YourJourney folder.

For Campaigns, you need to create a new folder in you YourJourney folder that matches the weird folder name you find while exploring this GitHub project, e.g. "f031456a-f949-42ef-9afc-c71735aa2eed". (This is in a folder called Campaigns/Scouring of the Shire but only the "f031456a-f949-42ef-9afc-c71735aa2eed" folder goes in your YourJourney folder.

Then for all the files in that "f031456a-f949-42ef-9afc-c71735aa2eed" folder on GitHub, download the Raw file as named and save them in your "f031456a-f949-42ef-9afc-c71735aa2eed" folder.

You can also download the whole YourJourneysScenarios project by clicking the green "<> Code v" button, choosing "Download ZIP", unzipping that file, and copying the Standalone .jime files you want directly into your YourJourney folder, or copying the "weird" Campain folders (e.g. "f031456a-f949-42ef-9afc-c71735aa2eed") and their contents directly into your YourJourney folder.
