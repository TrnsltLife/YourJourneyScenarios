## Downloading and Installing
You can download a Standalone scenario by following these steps:
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/TrnsltLife/YourJourneyScenarios/releases) section of this project. Each release contains one or more .jime or .zip files. .jime files represent Standalone Scenarios, while .zip files represent multi-scenario Campaigns.
2. Download the files you want to the Your Journey folder which was described above.
3. .jime files can be used directly at that point.
4. If you download a Campaign .zip like [Shadows.of.Mirkwood.zip](https://github.com/TrnsltLife/YourJourneyScenarios/releases/tag/shadows-of-mirkwood-v1.0-play-with-YourJourney-v0.36), you can place it directly in your Your Journey folder, and the game should install the campaign the next time you run the game.
