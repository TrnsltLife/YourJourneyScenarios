# YourJourneyScenarios
Scenarios for [Your Journey](https://github.com/TrnsltLife/your-journey) game app

## Windows users
Scenarios need to be stored in your Documents/YourJourney folder (which should be created automatically the first time you run the game).

## Mac users
Scenarios need to be stored in your /Users/(your-user-name)/Your Journey folder (which should be created automatically the first time you run the game).

## Downloading and Installing
You can download a Standalone scenario by following these steps:
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/TrnsltLife/YourJourneyScenarios/releases) section of this project. Each release contains one or more .jime or .zip files. .jime files represent Standalone Scenarios, while .zip files represent multi-scenario Campaigns.
2. Download the files you want to the Your Journey folder which was described above.
3. .jime files can be used directly at that point. But you'll need to unzip any Campaigns and store the zipped directory and its files in the Your Journey folder. e.g. the Scouring_of_the_Shire_v0.21.zip contains a folder named "f031456a-f949-42ef-9afc-c71735aa2eed" and that folder with all its contents should be placed in the Your Journey folder alongside the Standalone .jime files.
